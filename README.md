# Workday-Planner
## Description

Welcome to the Workday-Planner!

I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day . This app should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### Acceptance Criteria

```

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


```
